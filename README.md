## Installation

### Prerequisites

### Step-by-Step Guide

   - Click the green "Code" button at the top of this page.
   - Copy the repository link and clone it using Git, or download it as a ZIP file.

2. **Import the Script into Roblox Studio**
   - Open Roblox Studio and create a new project or open an existing one.
   - Drag and drop the script files from the repository into the desired folders (e.g., `StarterPlayerScripts`, `ReplicatedStorage`, etc.).

3. **Configure the Settings**
   - Open the `Config` module to adjust fishing parameters, such as fish types, rarity, and rewards.

   - Use the debugging tools in Roblox Studio to fine-tune the fishing mechanics.

## How It Works

1. **Player Interaction**
   - Players interact with a fishing spot to initiate the fishing process.
   - The system detects player input (e.g., pressing a key or clicking) to cast the fishing rod.

2. **Fishing Timer**
   - A countdown timer determines when a fish bites the bait.
   - Real-time prompts notify players to "reel in" when a fish is hooked.

3. **Catch Results**
   - After successfully reeling in, players receive a random fish based on the configured probability system.
   - Results include fish size, rarity, and in-game currency or experience points.

4. **Inventory Management**
   - Players can store, sell, or showcase their catches using the built-in inventory system.
